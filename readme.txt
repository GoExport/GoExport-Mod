Welcome to the GoExport Mod for Wrapper Offline.
This mod is meant to integrate GoExport into Wrapper Offline cleanly efficiently, and as natively as possible.

With this mod you get access to the following:
Direct integration with GoExport with a click of a button
A custom settings menu to control GoExport's behaviors
New and improved player which works flawlessly with GoExport.

Requirements
GoExport Mod requires the following:
Wrapper Offline v2.0.0 or v2.0.1 (Compatibility with other wrapper versions/mods may not be compatible.)
GoExport installed to your computer via the windows installer, or manually with the Linux package

Note that GoExport on Linux requires additional configuring: Register the "goexport://" protocol to run GoExport_CLI and add GoExport to your paths. (This allows other applications to use GoExport)
This modification (you got this!)

How to install GoExport Mod
Simply follow the instructions:
Drag "resources" into Wrapper Offline's root directory (/)
Click "Replace all" (You want to replace the files)
Delete the file located in resources > app > _SAVED > settings.json, deleting this will reset your settings, but it will not get rid of your data. It will only reinitialize your settings, which is needed for this mod.
That's it! You should now see a lightning bolt icon next to every video, click on that, and your video will export.

Note: remember that this mod makes modifications to player.swf, list.css, list.eta, database.js, settings.eta. Do not overwrite these files as even overwriting one file will break the mod.
